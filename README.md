## Overview

### NO Flex/Grid

‚úÖ Used the `columns`:  
`columns: 3` >  
`display: inline-block`

### Semantics of the complex header

The usage of `hgroup` has changed (years ago), and according to the official WHATWG Living Standard <time datetime="2023-06-12">12 June 2023</time>:

![The WHATWG standard for the hgroup tag](_challenge/screenshot/hgroup-whatwg.png)

But, unfortunately, the official W3C validator, which is also referred to by WHATWG, does not know about this and issues an error üò•

![The Nu Html Checker error about the hgroup tag](_challenge/screenshot/hgroup-validator-bug.png)

‚ö†Ô∏è Don't blindly trust "The Nu Html Checker" - its database is out of date.

‚úÖ Used the `hgroup`:  
`<hgroup>` >  
`<p>` + `<h1>`

### SVG all-in-one

‚úÖ Added all the icons in one file and change them via URL#fragment:
```css
.icon {
  display:none;
}

#icon-id:target {
  display:inline;
}
```

### \[role=img] to IMG\[href=*.svg] for accessibility purposes

‚úÖ Added extra `[role=img]` attribute for `<img>`, as [recommended by MDN](https://webkit.org/b/216364)

### Tablet version breakpoint

‚úÖ Added a breakpoint for tablets

### Top borders

To match the design, it's not possible to simply set `border-top: 4px solid border`, we end up with ~4px of extra radius:

![~4px of extra radius on border-top](_challenge/screenshot/border-solid.png)

‚úÖ Added a wrapper element, with a `border-color` background, `border-radius`, and top padding `border-top-width`:

![border-top according to design](_challenge/screenshot/border-padding.png)

```css
.wrap-tool {
  background: #44d3d2;
  border-radius: 8px;
  padding-top: 4px;
}

.tool {
  background: #fff;
}
```

### Titles 36/54, but not!

By design, subtitle and title:
- font-size: 36px
- line-height: 54px

But the total height of these elements is 102px, which is clearly $` ‚â† 54 + 54 `$

![Title group height](_challenge/screenshot/title-group.png)

‚úÖ Reduced the line heights to 51px.

### Lighthouse
